# Ethernaut challenges

Scripts are tested on contracts deployed on local Ethereum network with Hardhat.

Stage 9 is tested on rinkeby network as King's challenge cannot be tested locally.  
Stage 10 is similarly tested on rinkby network. Pretty annoying stage due to not realising reason for transaction reverting as we have to manually handle gas fees required by the recursive call

Contract address in scripts are the specific address instance deployed during testing. Deploy your own instance to test if needed.

Player address is a random address taken from one of the 20 accounts provided in local network
